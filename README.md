#This is the second take of the Sample_App I started working on a few weeks ago.

The original application can be found at https://github.com/kohrVid/sample_app and is likely to remain unfinished as I managed to finish the tutorial the second time around. The sample app created here deviates from Michael Hartl's tutorial in that it displays the user's feed when a mistake in the micropost form.
